â›” DEPRECATED. This example was deprecated. Starting from version 17.1, we introduced a new client-side <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientGridView.FocusedCellChanging">FocusedCellChanging</a> event. This event allows you to skip focusing and editing a cell. Refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T496531">ASPxGridView - Batch Edit mode - How to use the client-side FocusedCellChanging event and cancel editing or disable an editor conditionally</a> example for more details.
